<h2 align="center">Github Search Repositories</h2>

## About The Project

[Live Demo](https://github-search-repo-berkay.netlify.app/)
<br>
'Github repositories with search functionality' was developed in [React](https://reactjs.org/) with the help of [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/).

## Getting Started

### Starting The Development Server

First of all, clone the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/BerkayyyU/github-search-repo.git
```

Open your terminal, navigate to the app's directory, and install the required dependencies.

```
npm install
```

Start the development server.

```
npm start
```

As soon as the project compiles, a new tab with address http://localhost:3000 will open on your default browser.

### Running Storybook

```
npm run storybook
```

## Feedback

After months of developing with Angular, I realized that I missed React. It was a lot of fun for me to use [Github API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) and [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for the first time. I would be appreciated to hear your feedback.
